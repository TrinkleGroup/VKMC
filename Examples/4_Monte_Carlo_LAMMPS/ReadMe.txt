-This file describes all the options that can be used in running the Init_state_MC module
with the LAMMPS package to compute energies of FCC CoNiCrFeMn supercells to perform Metropolis
Monte Carlo runs.

NOTE: the location of the LAMMPS executable must be saved in the $PATH environment
variable with the name LMPPATH.

-Minimization is done with the conjugate gradient algorithm as implemented in LAMMPS with a
relative energy tolerance of 1e-5.

-The Monte Carlo simulations consist of successive Metropolis trial steps, which correspond to
swapping the positions of two different atoms and accepting the move with a probability.

-At first, a few thermalization steps are performed (specified with option --Neqb) and
then the supercells are saved after every specified number of steps (specified by --Nsave).

- To get started:
	1. An example slurm job script ("job_script_MC.sb") to run the simulations is provided to
	give an example of how to run the simulations.
	- Typically, we run multiple Monte Carlo simulations (we call them Job1, Job2,...)
	- In each simulation, we run multiple trajectories (trajectories 1, 2, ...)
	- In each trajectory, we start from a random state and gather states from --Neqb + --Nsave to --Nsteps number of steps
	(see option descriptions below).

	2. An example notebook named "Extract_states.ipynb" is provided, to show how to extract these states saved as
	ASE supercells (in pickle files) and store them into numpy arrays for use as initial states for Kinetic Monte
	Carlo simulations.

-For more details, please see the test notebook in the same directory as the Init_state_MC module.
